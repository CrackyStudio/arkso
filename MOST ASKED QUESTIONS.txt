What is the Actual Version?
Version 3.2

I want to submit a suggestion, where should I do?
You can contact me at cracky.studio@gmail.com.

It is planned to translate this freeware into the most common languages?
Actually not. I'm not able to do that myself.

Sometimes English syntax is incorrect, why?
English is not my native language, I practise it every day but it is not perfect.

The picture show that the server is ON but it is not showing up in servers list, why ?
First, you will need to know that the picture go ON when 'ShooterGameServer.exe' process go ON.
So, it can happen for some reasons:
- The server is still in launching phase
- You missed a launch setting
- A launch setting has been badly filled
- You got a problem with port opening

It is possible to use this tool for multiple server instances?
Not now. Not planned.

It is planned to add a mod loader?
Yes, I'll try.

How to use a custom map? The Volcano for instance?
Right now it's not possible.

After the tool update, I got an error, why and what to do?
Go on your Desktop. You have a new folder containing the updated app. You can delete the outdated app.

I've the error "Could not start process ShooterGameServer.exe"
That can happen for some reasons:
- You choose the wrong path. You must choose the 'SteamCMD' path, not his container. You must fill the folder containing the 'SteamCMD.exe' file. 
- Some files are damaged or missing. Redownload the server files.

How to enable Custom Command Line Arguments & Options?
Click on the little picture at right of the both textboxes.

Where are stored backups?
In your SteamCMD Folder, you should have a new folder called 'ARKSO - Server Backup'. In this folder, you have each backups stored by date & hours. AutoBackup is limited to one per day. 
Be careful that your drive is not overdriven, in which case the backup will not be made. It is also possible that it causes a crash of ARKSO.
