ARK Server Organiser (ARKSO) works with SteamCMD to bring an interface to your ARK: Survival Evolved dedicated server to make your setup as easy as possible.

## Development & History
ARKSO is developed with Visual Studio Community 2019 and is compatible only on Windows.
Steam Logon isn't required but you must have an internet connection to use it.

From v1.0 to v4.3, ARKSO was developed in vb.net. Due to some issues and bad coding practices, ARKSO moved to C#.
Changelog is available [here][changelog]

## About SteamCMD
The Steam Console Client or SteamCMD is a command-line version of the Steam client. Its primary use is to install and update various dedicated servers available on Steam using a command-line interface. It works with games that use the SteamPipe content system. All games have been migrated from the deprecated HLDSUpdateTool to SteamCMD.
