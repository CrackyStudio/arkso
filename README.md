ARK Server Organiser (ARKSO) works with SteamCMD to bring an interface to your dedicated server to make your server setup the easiest possible.

## Development
ARKSO is developed with Visual Studio Community 2019 and is compatible only on Windows.
Steam Logon isn't required but you must have an internet connection to use it.

## About SteamCMD
The Steam Console Client or SteamCMD is a command-line version of the Steam client. Its primary use is to install and update various dedicated servers available on Steam using a command-line interface. It works with games that use the SteamPipe content system. All games have been migrated from the deprecated HLDSUpdateTool to SteamCMD.
