This freeware is still under development. If you have any suggestions or requests, contact me at cracky.studio@gmail.com

Developed with Visual Studio Community and compatible only on Windows.

Steam Logon is not required but internet connection is required.
Witout internet connection, the app can works but the server will be up for LAN only.

SteamCMD installer is packed-in (3.0 feature), and must be installed.

Do not forget to open your ports and to allow 'ShooterGameServer.exe' in your firewall / AV.
If you don't do it, the server will be up only for the computer hosting it.
